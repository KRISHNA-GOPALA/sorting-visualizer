# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
This is an interactive web-based sorting algorithm visualizer that demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work in real-time. It provides options to adjust the array size and sorting speed while offering an intuitive and responsive UI.

## Features
- **Selection Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- Adjustable **array size**
- Adjustable **sorting speed**
- **Audio feedback** during sorting

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for functionality and sorting algorithms

## Installation & Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Adjust settings such as array size and speed.
4. Click on any sorting algorithm button to visualize it.

## File Structure
- `index.html` - The main interface of the visualizer.
- `index.css` - Styles for the user interface.
- `script.js` - Contains logic for setting up the array and implementing sorting algorithms.
- `beep.js` - Generates audio feedback during sorting.

## How It Works
- The array bars are generated randomly at the start.
- Selecting a sorting algorithm animates the process.
- Each algorithm has a distinct color scheme to indicate comparisons and swaps.
- Users can adjust sorting speed for better visualization.
